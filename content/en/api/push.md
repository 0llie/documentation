Mastodon natively supports the [Web Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API). You can utilize the same mechanisms for your native app. For a reference, see [Mozilla's web push server](https://github.com/mozilla-services/autopush), and more practically, see:

- [toot-relay](https://github.com/DagAgren/toot-relay)
- [PushToFCM](https://github.com/tateisu/PushToFCM)

Using the Web Push API requires your app to have the `push` scope.
